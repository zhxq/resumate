Of course, you can expand functionalities of Resumate by writing your own templates as well.",

For each JSON configuration file, <code>name</code>, <code>type</code> are required, with optional <code>content</code> and <code>vars</code>. The JSON above defined a page, which will be rendered as a page to be read by visitors. It contains a string with HTML markup, a link to http://example.com/ showing “This is a link”, two highlighted blocks for JSON (just like the one you see above), and quoted a block called <code>someblock</code>. You can write HTML in an ordinary string, and it will be rendered as well since Resumate will transparently pass HTML strings without any treatment.",

Resumate also comes with multi-language and site theme support, so you don't need to worry about globalizing or beautifying your page.<br><br>You can also find the JSON source code of <i>this</i> page you are currently reading - on <a href=\"https://github.com/zhxq/resumate/blob/master/definitions/pages/home.json\">GitHub</a>.",
