        "sitethemesintroline2": "Since Resumate is not only a renderer/parser (in fact, it is more like a standard because the main thing we have defined is about how to write JSON configuration files), therefore for the sake of interoperability between themes, there is a list of loose standards that all themes should follow. Theoretically, users can even implement the Resumate renderer standard using another language! As long as different implementations follow the same standard, this is not a problem at all.",
        "sitethemesintroline3": "First, Resumate should support jQuery, which can let JavaScript code in user-defined JavaScript in Pages/Blocks/Templates run easier. Besides, the standard of <code>settings.json</code> should be preserved in any theme: i.e., themes should be able to interprete menu entries and perform new page requests to <code>renderer.php</code> by using a POST method with filename=file.json. After the content is returned from <code>renderer.php</code>, the theme should be able to parse the content in the returned JSON - and load all JS files in the returned list of JS files, then show HTML on the screen.",
        "sitethemesintroline4": "Themes should be placed under a user-defined folder under ./themes, which name will be the name of that theme. To change the theme of your site, you can change the value of <code>theme</code> in <code>settings.json</code>. The main file for the theme should be named as <code>index.php</code> under the theme folder, with <code>func.php</code> as a list of theme-defined functions and <code>action.php</code> for theme-defined front-end vs. back-end interactions.",
        "sitethemesintroline5": "Resumate also provides a list of PHP functions can be used by themes. <code>getSetting($settingName)</code> allows users to get settings from <code>settings.json</code> given a key, and <code>getLocalizedSetting($settingName)</code> is similar but only accepts a key which has a value of a reference to a Macro (i.e. starts and ends with $ sign, just like how you refer to Macro values in other configuration files), and the function will return the correct value automatically depending on language, which is very useful for rendering site title and menu entries.",

Writing a template is very close to writing a page, and our goal now is to write templates for us and others to use. Template can be defined as \"a smallest collection of things for a well-defined feature\", which means we need to think thoroughly about what feature to be accomplished for this template before writing code. A very good principle is \"Unix Philosophy\": do one thing only and do it right. Consider using Blocks if you want to make a collection of features - that is what it was designed for.",
        "writingtemplatesintroline2": "To better illustrate the way of writing a template, now we are going to create a new template from scratch. Suppose we are creating a template for showing personal working experiences, then we need to think about what to be included in this template. Usually working experiences include job position, company name, dates, and a not-too-long description elaborating the experience. Using this as the principle, now we can start creating this template. First we start again from necessary <code>name</code> and <code>type</code>. Since this is a template for working experiences, we call it \"workexp\", which means <code>name</code> should be a string \"workexp\", with filename as workexp.json at ./definitions/templates; obviously, <code>type</code> should be \"template\".",
        "writingtemplatesintroline3": "The next step is the formatted contents. We choose to use a <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code> tag for job position, company name and dates, then comes a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag to put the working experience description. Natually we would want the users pass those values to the template, so the template can show different information at the right places, and we can use Macros to accomplish this. To prevent possible Macro naming conflicts, we should add a prefix for every Macro in this template - usually derived from template name using acronyms. <span style=\"color: red;\">However, names for Macros appearing in Templates must start with an underscore, otherwise the parser may get into an infinite loop. For example: if template A refers template B, which then refers to template C, and C refers to Template A even with some other contents, if A is not using Macro names starting with underscore, then Resumate renderer may halt.</span> Now we have following Macros: <code>_wexp_template_title</code>, <code>_wexp_template_company</code>, <code>_wexp_template_fromtime</code>, <code>_wexp_template_totime</code>, and<code>_wexp_template_description</code>. We should also add <code>_wexp_template_align</code> to let users change text alignments easily.",
        "writingtemplatesintroline4": "Now we have finished with the contents and formats, but we can still improve this by defining placeholders for those Macros, which can be used to notice users the usage of the Macro and prove the correctness of their configuration file by showing someting on screen.",

This is a better way of writing page configuration files, as we separated different parts of the page into smaller blocks，sanitating the page with a rich content with better maintainability. Thus we can define a page called <code>page1</code>, with a title on top and blocks below: ",
        "pagesintroline3": "...and now we get deeper with the configuration file for <code>blocka</code> - <code>blockb</code> and <code>blockc</code>are similar, but of course we need to change them into something else according to their real contents, respectively.",

Suppose we need to call some JavaScript methods and/or make use of some external css definitions, then we can use <code>js</code> and/or <code>css</code> list(s) to define required JS/CSS files. Resumate will load all necessary JavaScript files first, then load the HTML rendered by Resumate, which can prevent JavaScript code defind in HTML calling functions in not-yet-loaded JS files. For the sake of loading speed, Resumate will first fetch all JS files first (in no particular order and with maximum possible concurrency), then load the HTML with CSS requisites defined as <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>s on the top of HTML. <code>js</code> and <code>css</code> are also available in Blocks, Templates and HTML definitions, with full support on local and remote files.

Be cautious on the URL you listed in your configurations: Resumate will automatically check if the URL for your JS/CSS file starts with //，http:// or https://. If so, Resumate will consider this as an absolute path and will leave the path unmodified; otherwise it will consider the path as a relative path and add the path of that configuration file to that JS/CSS file. Similarly, Resumate will request some.css from example.com and my.css under ./definition/pages/css. Don't assume Resumate will load these files in order, but remember: Resumate will print the rendered HTML on the page after all JS files are loaded. If you want to execute some JS code after the page shows, then consider adding a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> - Choose whatever way you like: by a simple HTML string, or using the HTML definition provided by Resumate. A great instance for this scenario can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/zhxq/resumate/blob/master/definitions/templates/jsoncode.json\">here</a>, the definition of <code>jsoncode</code>, a template showing highlighted and formatted JSON code.",

        "htmlintroductionbasicsline2": "Similar to Pages, Blocks and Templates, there are also some required information in HTML definitions. <code>name</code>, <code>type</code> and <code>content</code> are still important and crucial as before, but HTML definitions have two more required properties: <code>attr</code> can be used to define HTML tag attributes (For normal attributes, simple key-value pair in <code>attr</code> is enough. However, for <code>style</code>, it should be a dict - containing style-related key-value pairs - in <code>attr</code>. Similarly, <code>class</code> should be a JSON list with a list of classes), and <code>close</code> as a boolean to indicate if an HTML tag should close (e.g.: <code>&lt;a&gt</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt</code> should close, but <code>&lt;img&gt</code> doesn't). Please take a look on the definition for <code>p</code> tag below: ",
        "htmlintroductionbasicsline3": "But there is one reminder: when quoting HTML tags in other configuration files, the <code>content</code> must be a JSON list. The reason is that there is a minor difference between <code>content</code> in HTML tags and <code>content</code> in Pages, Blocks and Templates: <code>content</code> in HTML tags supports prefixes and postfixes to be clipped onto given content passed into that HTML tag, which made some HTML tags make more sense and more flexible, especially for tags like <code>table</code> and <code>ul</code>, having too many similar tags inside them controlling the format. Please take a look on the definition for <code>ul</code> tag below: ",

Using Resumate, it is able to refer the template ten times and give title, authors, description and link easily, instead of copying and pasting HTML for ten times and insert those information in their repective places. Resumate also comes with multi-language and site theme support, so you don't need to worry about globalizing or beautifying your page.<br><br>You can also find the JSON source code of <i>this</i> page you are currently reading - on <a href=\"https://github.com/zhxq/resumate/blob/master/definitions/pages/home.json\">GitHub</a>.",
