        "introductiontoresumateoutofboxline1": "Just want to use it out of the box? It's easy. Resumate comes with multi-language support (with configuration files located under ./definition/lang), and you can define different strings for different languages. You can refer to existing files under ./definitions/pages (defining Pages - to be rendered for visitors) and ./definition/blocks (defining Blocks, for the sanitation and modularization of Pages) and writing your own configuration files. You can also refer to the configuration used by the academic page of Resumate's original author here.",
        "introductiontoresumateoutofboxline2": "After finishing your own configuration files, you need to modify <code>settings.json</code> for site configurations, in which you can modify site title, SEO information, menu settings (defining pages can be referred by the menu), and supported languages.",
        "introductiontoresumateoutofboxline3": "Menu settings are defined by the dict <code>menu</code>. Each key in this dict will be the filename of that page configuration (e.g.: key name “home” means the file will be ./definitions/pages/home.json). <code>readable</code> defines the text to be shown on the menu, <code>right</code>, a boolean, indicates if the option will be put on the right side of the menu. <code>dropdown</code>, an optional key with a dict as content, is similar to dict <code>menu</code> itself, with key name referring to the page file and <code>readable</code> as the string to be displayed.",
        "introductiontoresumateoutofboxline4": "In configuration files, almost all values support multi-language. For instance, if you defined a string with key name <code>somestring</code> in your language files, you can refer that string by using <code>\"$somestring$\"</code> when needed. Similar usage applies to other configuration files.",
        "introductiontoresumateoutofboxline5": "If you are still confused about writing configuration files, we recommend you to read the configuration files of this block, along with each block on this page (you can find links next to every chapter title). Please don't hesitate to ask us on GitHub or checkout the code used by the original author of Resumate on his personal academic website.",
        "introductiontoresumatebasicstitle": "Basics",
        "introductiontoresumatebasicsline1": "Resumate is a handy tool to write your personal site. You don't need to know anything about writing codes - just write definitions to tell what you are going to show to your visitors, using some predefined templates. Of course, you can expand functionalities of Resumate by writing your own templates as well.",
        "introductiontoresumatebasicsline2": "Different kinds of configuration files should be placed under different directories. Pages should be placed under <code>./definition/pages</code>, blocks should be placed under <code>./definition/blocks</code>, templates should be placed under <code>./definition/templates</code>, and finally HTML definitions should be placed under <code>./definition/html</code>. To better illustrate the grammar of these files, here is a basic Resumate Page configuration file:",
        "introductiontoresumatebasicsline3": "There are four different types of <i>renderable</i> configuration files for Resumate: page, block, template and html, in an decomposing order, and they have similar grammars (especially for the first three kinds). For each JSON configuration file, <code>name</code>, <code>type</code> are required, with optional <code>content</code> and <code>vars</code>. The JSON above defined a page called <code>newpage</code>, which will be rendered as a page to be read by visitors. It contains a string with HTML markup, a link to http://example.com/ showing “This is a link”, two highlighted blocks for JSON (just like the one you see above), and referred a block called <code>someblock</code>. You can write HTML in an ordinary string, and it will be rendered as well since Resumate will transparently pass HTML strings without any treatment.",
        "introductiontoresumatebasicsline4": "For pages, blocks and templates, <code>content</code> - a JSON-format list, is very important. It defined how to refer existing pages, blocks, templates and/or html.",
        "introductiontoresumatebasicsline5": "Some Macros are also defined in the JSON above. <code>vars</code> located at the bottom defined two Macros with a scope of the file itself, plus all referred configuration files (recursively). Those two Macros will be used if these two Macros were not defined in the file referred this JSON file (in other words, this section defined default values for these two Macros to be applied in this file and all its subsidiaries). A little more elaboration: If file A referred file B, which then referred file C, then if a Macro is defined in A, then the definition for the value of that Macro in B or C will be void - the value of that Macro from A will be used. Macros defined in language files will be read by the renderer before any other configuration files (except settings.json) are parsed, so the Macros defined in language files will have a global scope that can be used in any configuration file. In the <code>content</code>, we have referred a list of block, template, and html files, and we can pass existing Macros, a simple string, or a reference to (even a list of) other page/site/template configuration file(s) (which will be parsed into an HTML string) to them.",
        "introductiontoresumatetemplatestitle": "Templates",
        "introductiontoresumatetemplatesline1": "Template is the core of Resumate. It defines an abstract template which can be used over and over again (e.g.: a formatted list of someone's academic papers, or a place to automatically render a piece of code). Modularization is crucial to keep codes simple and readable, with ability to be reused and shared.",
        "introductiontoresumatetemplatesline2": "The following example is <code>titlewdiv</code> template used by this site again and again. It contains a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> html element, with contents from top to bottom: an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> html element and a <code>cdiv</code> template.",
        "introductiontoresumatetemplatesline3": "See those Macros with prefix <code>twd_template_</code>? Those are the Macros used in this template, which will be substituted with real contents when rendered. We recommend you to add some identical prefix for the Macros when writing a template. If you want to define default values for some Macros used in this template, you can consider add those in the <code>vars</code> dict located at the root of the template configuration with the format shown above.",
